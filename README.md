Hi **Piyush Prajapati** (Roll No: **24B0930**) this side.Untill Now the project has been unfolded in two stages 
## Network Simulator
For the following assignment the viewer can simply walkthrough to P2P_generator.ipynb to see how code works
Or just to regenerate network.png the generator.py file can be run . The code uses following libraries so make sure to have them :
- matplotlib
- networkx
- time,random,queue included in std libraries 
- It uses python3

## Simulation of a P2P Cryptocurrency Network
The code is in SimulationofaP2pCryptocurrencyNetwork notebook and is divided and has several classes defined which can be understood through report provided. The code uses:
- random
- queue 
- time 
- uuid 
- heapq
- matplot 
- networkx 

The debugging and reading observations of the simulator have still not been done yet (until 27th).The structure and code logic is clear though.
