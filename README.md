## üìö Overview
Hey , I am **Piyush Prajapati** (Roll No : **24B0930**) . This repo is corresponding to my SOC project under WNCC under my soc mentor **Soumitra Darshan Nayak** .
This repository contains three key projects related to blockchain technology and decentralized applications, completed as part of the **Blockchain Arena** course and related assignments. These projects demonstrate core concepts including P2P network simulation, discrete event-driven blockchain simulation, and building a decentralized item registry on Ethereum.
